## Basic demographics and statistics (HC2)
SoHo, short for "South of Houston Street" in Manhattan, New York City, is a trendy neighborhood known for its mix of art, culture, and historic architecture. The demographics include professionals, young adults, families, and tourists. The area, represented by zip codes 10012 and 10013, is a popular tourist destination for fashion and architecture enthusiasts.

The neighborhood has become home to some of the most expensive real estate in the country, with over 80% of housing units occupied, but only 28% owned by homeowners. The majority (72%) of residents rent, and almost 90% of the properties are valued over $1 million. As of July 2023, SoHo home prices increased by 27.8%, with a median price of $3.1M.

The population, around 52,000, has a slight majority of single residents. The middle 50% age range is 20-50, predominantly white. The average household income is $248,830, but the median income is $127,576. The population has an almost equal male-to-female ratio, with 85% having completed high school and nearly 97% employed. Approximately 70% have completed a bachelor's degree or higher.

Despite the affluent demographic, 10.23% of SoHo's population is below the poverty line, matching the official rate of 11.6%. About 70% of vacant units are not on the market. Only 20% of the population lived in SoHo before the 2000s, suggesting it's not a common choice for permanent residence. Nearly 50% of residents commute to work by public transit, with less than a 30-minute commute on average.

## HC3 Summary
Converting buildings to cleaner heating fuels is a complex challenge in addressing the heating sector's impact on climate change. Effective strategies include electrification, renewable natural gas, and policy implementation with fiscal incentives. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in their Faster Innovation Case, electrification, CCUS, and bioenergy contribute significantly to additional emission cuts by 2050.

The IEA emphasizes the efficiency of electric heat pumps, powered by natural resources. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) highlights renewable natural gases derived from various sources, including solid waste landfills and livestock farms. These gases can be used for thermal applications and electricity generation, providing cleaner heating options for building management.

Despite alternative options, policy implementation is crucial to encourage widespread adoption. The European Commission stresses the need for a collective effort by regional stakeholders and policymakers to transition to a climate-neutral economy. Fiscal incentives, such as tax credits, can play a role in motivating changes in upper management, contributing to the overall decarbonization of the environment. Ultimately, without significant cost savings or mandatory requirements, widespread adoption of cleaner heating fuels may be challenging.

## HC4 Summary
We learned about how NYC's reliance on aging power plants and the use of natural gas contribute to high emissions and air pollutants. Buildings, especially in Manhattan, are identified as the largest source of GHG emissions, with a notable concentration in properties built in the 1950s. Legislation such as Local Law 97 aims to reduce emissions from large buildings, which are responsible for a substantial portion of carbon dioxide output. The text also highlights the energy inefficiency of appliances in Manhattan's densely populated buildings and the strain they place on electricity consumption. Despite these challenges, NYC is implementing measures to reduce emissions, such as the 2026 law banning fossil fuels in most new buildings.
## HC7 and HC8 Summary
In HC7/HC8, I learned some things. First, I learned that out of all our neighborhoods in Manhattan, we found out that Hells Kitchen has the highest Mean Total Gallons. Here is the graph:

I also learned that there is no correlation between the number of floors and the total amount of gallons in each building. Here is the graph:

Finally, I learned about the ages of boilers in each building. Most boilers are between 10 to 30 years old. Here is the graph:

In conclusion, we learned a lot about our neighborhood's buildings and a lot about cleaning and visualizing data to convey certain trends or statistics that are important.
